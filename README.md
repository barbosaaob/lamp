Abstract:
Multidimensional projection techniques have experienced many
improvements lately, mainly regarding computational times and
accuracy. However, existing methods do not yet provide flexible enough
mechanisms for visualization-oriented fully interactive applications.
This work presents a new multidimensional projection technique
designed to be more flexible and versatile than other methods. This
novel approach, called Local Affine Multidimensional Projection
(LAMP), relies on orthogonal mapping theory to build accurate local
transformations that can be dynamically modified according to user
knowledge. The accuracy, flexibility and computational efficiency of
LAMP is confirmed by a comprehensive set of comparisons. LAMP’s
versatility is exploited in an application which seeks to correlate
data that, in principle, has no connection as well as in visual
exploration of textual documents.
